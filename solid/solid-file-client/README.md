# Solid Hello World (solid-file-client)

This is a simple application illustrating how to get started with [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) using the [solid-file-client](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client) library.

It only has two dependencies: [an authentication library](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js) and [solid-file-client](https://github.com/jeff-zucker/solid-file-client). Everything else is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All the functionality related to Solid is contained in a single file; `solid.js`.

This example follows the same structure as other examples in this repository, so you can follow these [general instructions](../).
