# Glossary

- **Solid POD:** This is your personal storage where Solid applications store files.
- **Identity provider:** This is the service used to perform authentication, it is often served in the same url as your POD (but not always).
- **WebId:** The url that identifies you as a person, for example `https://noeldemartin.solidcommunity.net/profile/card#me`. WebIds can also identify organizations and groups, it's not limited to individuals.
- **Solid document:** Data stored in your POD can either be a binary, like an image or video, or an RDF document. Although these are called documents, this doesn't mean that they are stored in a text file. Documents are represented by a url, and the Solid POD can persist them in any way (text files, database, etc.).
- **Solid container:** A collection of documents and binary resources. [Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp-primer/).
- **Solid Profile:** This is the document that contains information about you. It is the document that contains your webId. For example `https://noeldemartin.solidcommunity.net/profile/card`.
- **RDF:** Resource Definition Framework, the abstract data representation for data in Solid. [Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/).
- **Turtle:** A specific RDF encoding format. [Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/).
- **SPARQL:** Query language used to query RDF data. [Learn more](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/).
