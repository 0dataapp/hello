# Glossary

- **Webnative**: The name of the Fission SDK. Currently focused on Fission infrastructure, the goal is to be fully decentralised. [Learn more](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative).
- **WNFS**: Short for Web Native File System. A filesystem with both encrypted and public files. Access is granted through private keys. [Learn more](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/file-system-wnfs).
- **Auth lobby**: The authentication/authorisation lobby. Here lives your private key that has access to everything in your filesystem. From here you can link other devices and grant apps to specific parts of your data. [Learn more](https://guide.fission.codes/developers/webnative/auth).
- **DID**: Decentralised identifier, used to identify things or people. Fission accounts have both an associated username and a DID. [Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_identifiers).
- **UCAN**: User Controlled Authorization Network, is a specialised JWT (JSON Web Token) that allows you to do decentralised authorisation (not needing a centralised server). The lobby issues UCANs to apps and your other devices. [Learn more](https://github.com/ucan-wg/ts-ucan).
- **IPFS**: A distributed system for storing and accessing content-addressed data. Webnative and Fission uses this for networking and data transfer. [Learn more](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/what-is-ipfs/).
