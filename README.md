# Solid Hello World

This is a simple application illustrating how to get started with Solid.

It only has two dependencies: [an authentication library](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js) and [an RDF parsing library](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js). Everything else is plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
